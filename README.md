## 2020 F1 Circuits

Created using React.js, this app shows some brief information about each F1 race on the 2020 calendar - round no., track name, track map and race date - based on the drop-down selection.

The round numbers, track names and race dates are fetched from Ergast's API (http://ergast.com/mrd/), whereas the track maps are local files sourced from the F1 website.

The app is hosted on GitHub pages and can be accessed here: **https://ksells99.github.io/f1-circuits-react**
